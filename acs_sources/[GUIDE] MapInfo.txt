So MAPINFO as the name implies has the information about each map in therms of how they
are connected by episodes and even from "this map" -> "next map".

It has two to types of blocks:
- Episode
- Map


					/*------------------------------*/
					/*           EPISODES           */
					/*------------------------------*/

Episode CUSTM_N1				
{							
  name = ""
  picname = "CUSTOM_T"			
  NoSkillMenu
}

-------------



Episode [Your first map here]
------------------------------
Alongside "Episode" you have to put the file name of the first map of the episode.
It has to be the same name as the map file that are you working on
and it can't be more than 8 characters.
Like "ZOMBIE_P", "EVENIN_U", "PYRAMID", "TERAIS_F", "MIDNIGHT", etc.


name = [Unused]
----------------
ZAMN TC doesn't have fonts properly implemented at this moment so this is not used.
But it should take a font type and create a title for the episode with that font.


picname = [Your title graphic]
-------------------------------
As fonts are not implemented yet, ZAMN TC uses a graphic to display his episode titles.
The picname graphic replaces whatever is written in "name".
I'm not sure which are the limitations of it , but be my guest in experimenting with it ^^


[flags]
-------- 
This flags are needed to behave less than Doom and more like ZAMN.
The flags necessary for the episodes are:

NoSkillMenu




Map Example:
------------

Map CUSTM_N1 "Custom Level 1"
	{
    Sky1 = "Sky1", 0
	KeepFullInventory
	NoIntermission
	SpawnWithWeaponRaised
	Next = "CUSTM_N2"				// Next map if not a bonus
	SecretNext = "CUSTM_B1"			// Next map if bonus
	}

-------------



Map [Filename] "The map actual name"
---------------------------------------
The filename is the name of the file of this map. 	Example: "EVENIN_U"
It can be more than 8 characters and the episode will look for it 
if it is the first map of the episode.
The actual map of the name is the name displayed
that it will display in the automap.				Example: "Evening Of The Undead"


Sky1 = "Sky Texture", 0
---------------------------
GZDoom can use several methods to display skies in a map.
ZAMN TC uses two at the same time, most of the time.

The first method is a simple texture that you can put in "Sky Texture" and appears on the sky.
Like for example the "blue sky/clouds" in "Zombie Panic" uses this, but is not really good for other details like hills or scenery.


This is why the second method, the "SkyBox" is used as well.
Every map has is own SkyBox in a isolated part of the map, and is pretty much a box with textures and a camera point.
Like for example the "hills and little houses" in "Zombie Panic" uses this, and this creates a normally nice looking sky.


[flags]
----------
Every map needs this flags in his block of code, to bypass some Doom restrictions like: Intermission Screens, Inventory Reduction, etc.
The flags needed to be included are:

KeepFullInventory
NoIntermission
SpawnWithWeaponRaised


Next = "Next Map"
--------
This points to which map comes next when the player finishes the level by normal means, 
it will change to it after the showcase of the survivors rescued.
You need to write the file name of the map in here.


SecretNext = "Next Map"
--------
This point to which map comes next when the player finishes the level and found a BonusLevel token, 
it will change to it after the showcase of the survivors rescued.
You need to write the file name of the map in here.




The music of each map is written in the scripts of every map.
Check the "[Guide] Music Tracklist.txt" for more info.


Thanks for reading! ^^
