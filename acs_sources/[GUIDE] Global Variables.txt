This are global variables that the mod uses ((they have to be documented here if another one is added, 
to keep a better reference on which and why are they used, also to have some mod compatibility this reference
would help to check if there's compatibility issues)).
 
They can be accessed from anywhere as long as it is defined again in the script Library.
