+ "ZAMN_MAIN" (06th November, 2023) [Hotfix Stuff 1]
-------------------------------------------------------------
[Zamn TC]
- Reverted a couple of monsters wich where being tested with different damage values



+ "ZAMN_MAIN" (31th October, 2023) [DEVELOPMENT HELL IM SO SORRY]
-------------------------------------------------------------
[Zamn TC]
- Added bonus map "Cheerleaders Vs Monsters" (WIP)
- Added Office Tileset Decorations:: "Ceiling Web", "Drawer_Dark", "Chest_Dark"
- Added Pallete Translation for "Ants_Red"
- Added "Ants_Red" wip enemies
- Fixed stuttering on levels with tons of Mushroom/Spike Hazards enemies
- Rewrote Spike_Metal Hazards to improve performance
- Fixed oversight with the UFO Boss not seeing the player if it wasn't alerted first
- Added 3 keys to "Dinner On Monster Island" to prevent soft-lock if started the level from the Level Select.
- Moved "FireSeed" Hazard enemy to "GiantPod.dec" so it has a sensical location
- "FireSeed" now can drop a key on death and comes with two aditional palletes
- Added missing frame in Zeke's walking animation
- Prevented land monsters spawning/landing on water
- Werewolves would try to reach out of water if landed in there
- Added "GhostPotion" item
- Added "RandomPotion" item (Missing MrHyde mode)
- Added "FootBall" weapon
- Fixed oversight with "PoolDude" Survivor and Gillmens thinking it was outside of water
- Fixed an oversight on Level 11 "Weeds Gone Bad" which had a Survivor Spawn with tag 404.
	So it was being erased by error if the game was played on Software Mode.
- Added Error Warnings for Survivors:
	- If they didn't have their priority set
	- If the Spawner had Tag 404
- Fixed Hud Score not offsetted properly if the Aspect Ratio wasn't forced

[Zamn Core]
- Added 2-dimensional arrays to contain all the names of the Title Cards.
	One for the "Normal_Levels" and another for the "Bonus_Levels" and the previous system will be deprecated, 
	"Custom Levels" will not change though as they need the previous, more flexible approach.
- Re-organized the [Guide] documentation as .acs files so it's more accesible from map editors.
- Some cleaning of unnecesary acs libraries, and re-organized "LOADACS" as to portray better the libraries loaded.
- Re-organized "Maps" folder, compiled Custom Level maps into "Maps_3-Custom" and 
	compiled Menu maps into "Maps_0-Menu" as well. This was done to reduce clutter on the maps folder. 
- Separated "DoorsAndDrawers.dec" into "Doors.dec" and "Drawers.dec" 
	due to becoming both categories too big to mantain in the same file.
- Re-organized "Decorate_M/Decorations" folder, actors are now stored by level theme and interactive actors are stored separatedly.
	This should reduce clutter on the files, and also neccesary due some new rules.
- Reduced Door Colissions for the players, monsters still would walk around the doors, while being less restrictive on players.
	This was due that some maps like the current "Cheerleaders Vs Monsters" was hard to navigate due to not having enough space
	for the colission boxes, so navigation was uncomfortable.
- Standarized Doors! Doors are now divided on Normal|Normal(Mirror)| and Special|Special(Mirror) type of doors
	All door AI is now inherited, doors now just have to set the voxel frame and their inherited type will do the rest.
- Reworked how transformations work to implement RandomPotions
- Added a 2 seconds timer for the Exit Door, so the range in which activates grows by time.
	This helps with people which stayed still at the ExitDoor spawn and had trouble getting it to work.
- Reworked "GameOver" animation, instead of running both layers on a timer, the second will start when the first one is at the correct position.
	In handsight this approach makes more sense, hopefully it fixes once and for all the breaking "GameOver" screens.




+ "ZAMN_MAIN" (04th March, 2023) [February Demo, Sorry for being late! ;;]
-------------------------------------------------------------
[Zamn TC]
- Added Level 16 "From The Depths Of The Earth: Ants"
- Edited several sprites for the "Giant Ants"
- Added wip enemies "Giant Ants" with support for picking up 4 items (Bazooka/WaterPickup/ScoreA/ScoreB).

	it will be updated once I can connect it properly again )

[Add-Ons]
- "Beta_FrankesteinSprites" added, which replaces the Frankestein Sprites with the ones from the "Monsters" Beta version of ZAMN.

[LZDoom Exclusive]

	With this you won t need to download freedom neither, as you can run ZAMNTC now with "GameLoader" as a base.
- Added missing instructions for "DimColor" and "Help"/"Credits" flats.

[Easter Eggs]
- Offseted Julie's Ghoul Patrol sprites correctly (* missing jump animation offsets)



+ "ZAMN_MAIN" (03rd November, 2022) [HOTFIX_1]

-------------------------------------------------------------
[Zamn TC]

- Updated "RedAxeBaby.pk3" add-on, added new frame to match the updated Decorate file.

[Modding]
- (UDB Only:) Added Custom "ZZ_MonsterSpawn" actor, which spawns any actor/class wrote in their first argument.
	This is recommended to use with Spawnable Monsters, as to not have issues with overlapping id_numbers.
	There is a list which mentions which monsters should be spawnable without issues, 
		monster Bosses and NonSpawnables are excluded at the moment.






+ "ZAMN_MAIN" (12th October, 2022) [August Big Freaking Refactoring Demo + September Dinner On Monster Island Demo]
-------------------------------------------------------------
[Zamn Standalone/Zamn Core]
- Rewrote HUD display, now integrates a ZScript counterpart.
- Wrote a ZSCript Hud counterpart which handles weapon and item information and sends it to screen display.
- ACS HUD is still being used but mostly to drawn the HUD on screen and keep count of some variables,
	the ZSCript HUD retrieves the weapon/item information and passes it to the ACS part.
- ZSCript Hud can read "Selected Inventory" and "Selected Inventory Icon" directly from inventory.
- SBARINFO is deprecated.
- Updated/Reworked all weapons to work trough inheritance, for easier manteinance. 
- Weapons Codebase Improvements:
	- Now they dont need that "8 characters restriction" on their class name, thanks to ZSCript HUD.
	- Can now point their Hud Icon Graphic directly by using their "Inventory.Icon" property
	- Can now point their Ammo Type directly by using their "Weapon.AmmoType" property
	[Note: AmmoType of each weapons are not being changed, but they dont need to be "weaponname_Ammo" anymore]
- Survivors Codebase Improvements:
	- Rewrote Survivor Identification, Scripts that took number IDs now they work 
		instead with "Class Name" of the survivor Saved.
	- Rewrote Survivor Initialization, now they use a couple of auxiliar actors to set up necessary information,
		this allows for Custom Survivors to appear in any map without any special task needed.
- Monsters Codebase Improvements:
	- Started work on standarization, they share common values but common states should be considered as well.

- Standarized Weapons, they inherit from a master class called "WeaponClass_ZAMN" which contains general weapon properties.
- Standarized Monsters, they inherit from a master class called "MonsterClass_ZAMN" which contains general monster properties.
- Standarized Survivors, they inherit from a master class called "SurvivorBase_ZAMN" which contains general survivor properties.
- Added placeholder base code for missing weapons with their corresponding "DamageTypes".

- Ducktape fix for GameOver Screen not appearing correctly if all survivors died.
- Reworked "MonsterPlayer" classes, removed script for fixing missing inventory weapons,

	Thanks to the recent refactoring adding a survivor is very straightforward and the heavy coding stuff is handled internally.
	[You can check "CustomSurvivors.dec" or "SurvivorsGP.dec" to see some examples!]

- (UDB Only:) Added Custom "ZZ_WeaponPickup" actor, which spawns any actor/class wrote in their first argument.
	This is recommended to use with Custom Weapon Pickups for Add-On weapons, as to not have issues with overlapping id_numbers.

- (UDB Only:) Added Custom "ZZ_SurvivorSpawn" actor, which spawns any actor/class wrote in their first argument.
	This is recommended to use with Custom Survivors, as to not have issues with overlapping id_numbers.

- Fixed GameOver screen retriggering causing it to glitch out.

  which was causing a bug that bypassed invulnerability frames.
- Fixed an oversight with using a "MonsterPotion" while being revived wich caused the camera/invulnerability to break.
- Wrote a "HealthCheckHelper" script, to detect cummulative damage and fix the players health.
  This and the previous changes ^ should fix finally the issues with player invulnerability.
  //
- Reworked "Monster Spawners" and "MonsterAllow" script, to prevent them from giving a false positive about if monster limit wasn't reached.

- Fixed bug in which the monster could decide is not necessary to vanish even when the spawner explicitely said so.
- Improved monsters despawning and tweaked "Monster Spawners" to doublecheck in the sequences that have delays.

- Improved Doors reaction to MonsterFists punch.	//[ Bug Introduced by 31-01-22 demo, which reworked doors to block damage from TitanicStomp ]
	// I know that this is just a patch onto a possible bigger problem, but let's agree that actors loosing 
	// their colission after receiving damage should not be a common issue to fix neither.
- Tweaked some incorrectly offseted textures in "Zombie Panic".
- Reworked (several times) the Spikes/Mushroom enemies, they are now both not too performance heavy
  and Co-Op ready. //( They use CheckProximity to aquire target of one of the two players. They also have

- Tweaked "MonsterLess" script to not go under 0 possible spawns.
	In case that the spawn counter brokes by going over the limit, after despawning it could remediate itself.
- Fixed a wrong calculation of height, being used by the "RedBlobs". Now they shoot different projectiles 
  depending on the space that they have available. (As it was intended from the start)

[Modding]
- Added TitanicToddler variant "TT_FastSpawn" with the fast spawn animation as default, 
  can't be placed by a map editor but can be summoned by Survivor Scripts ^^
- Added a MapperScript called "SetCardTime", which in conjuntion with "CustomTitleCards" it can be used to set the time 
  for each card staying static on screen. More info in "[Guide]MapperScripts" ^^.

- Added Mapper Script "StopCountdown" which will stop any timer at the given time.
- Added a Start Script called "SetGoalCount" which it will launch sets a counter on screen and will launch a script specified by the mapper 
  if reached the goal.
- Added Mapper Scripts "AddOneToGoal"/"TakeOneToGoal"/"StopGoalCount" to control the Goal Count set previously.
- Added a "ZZ_Custom" group for custom actors.
- Expanded "SurvivorScripts" by adding a call case number 3. Which will indicate that 
  the survivor triggered their SurvivorScript, due to damage from a map script and not a monster.


[ZAMN TC]
- Added the Custom Level map: "Honey, I Enlarged The Kids" 
- Fixed doors opening with attacks of enemies, normal projectiles, or any other means available now or in the future
  by inverting their logic to only react by special damage from "Bazooka" or "MonsterFists" instead of telling them to not to react

- Removed an unnecesary call to "MonsterMore" and "MonsterLess" from Tentacle enemies.
- Somewhat fixed "Camera Change Breaking" / "Death Animation Breaking":
	There are several animations that where on conflict, like "Death Animation", "Player Invulnerability", "Stomped Invulnerability",
	"Bazooka Fire Invulnerabiity", "Crucifix Invulnerability", "MonsterPotion Invulnerability", etc.
	+ Now "StompedPain" script and "DeathCheck" script, will give the player a token
	  while this animations are playing, monster potion transformation will to.
	+ Bazooka Fire will play normally, but the "Bazooka Invulnerability" script
	  will not activate if "Stomp" or "DeathCheck" is running,
	  as this was overriding player attributes and nullyfying the changes supossed to occurr.
	+ Crucifix Fire will play normally, but the "Crucifix Invulnerability" script
	  will behave by the same rules as the Bazooka script.
	+ Most of the animation scripts would check if other animations are playing in an effort to avoid overwriting variables
	being used for the animations.
	
	There are still some cases that could break this animations, for example pressing "Fire" + "Jump" + "Movement" can cause
	some animations to break. But in a worst case scenario the script can continue and fix the player in a couple of seconds.

  Also the GooIcons and a timer appears on the HUD similar as the monster potion.

  which lets the mapper to execute scripts upon picking up a survivor or the death of a survivor.

  it will depend of the intentions of the mapper, this scripts have to be numbered and written in the GZDoomBuilder or
  map specific ACS.

[ZAMN Core]
- Written a grid display system to show graphics based on an array, somewhat easy to organize on screen but desigend for...

- Tweaked Crucifix weapons to slowdown the player 						[I can't make the player receive damage as the original ZAMN while using the crucifix,
  while being close to a FloorHazard that should stop him				 so this should be an equivalent trade-off to prevent players abusing Crucifixes	  ]
- Chainsaw Maniacs attacks now make less damage (From 20 to 15)			[P.S: Info about damage data of this enemy is necessary still]
- Fixed Mummys not despawning! 											[This should make the spawn spots on Level 6 work properly]
