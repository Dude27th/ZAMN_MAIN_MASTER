 
 Survivor Scripts:
 -----------------
 
 One of the new mechanics implemented recently is survivor scripts, due to how the survivors 
 are actually a group of actors this was kind of tricky to implement, but the results have potential.
 
 So, the SurvivorSpawns take as a second argument a number, if this number is '0' it would simply
 not activate a script but if specified otherwise, then it will call the numbered script
 upon pickup(save), death, or werewolf transformation of the specified survivor.
 
 _______________________________________________________________________
 
 Your numbered called script can have no argument:
 
 
 Script 123 (void)
 {
	...
 }
 _______________________________________________________________________
 
 _______________________________________________________________________
 
 Or it can have 1 argument, which is in this case the "Calling Motive":


 Script 123 (int CallMotive)
 {
	...
 }
 _______________________________________________________________________
 
 
 This optional argument is a number given by the survivor which specifies the conditions in 
 which the numbered scripts was called.
 This numbers mean:
 
0: "Save" or "Pickup" of the survivor
1: "Death" by normal means of the survivor 
2: "Werewolf Transformation" of the survivor



Using this number you can create different segments depending on the reason of calling it, allowing
more control to the mapper/modder but it is optional depending on what is being used for.

This "SurvivorScript" was meant to expand the level design capabilities of the ZAMN formula,
I plan on a future to add a campaing with interconected maps to this mod taking advantage of this 
SurvivorScripts but it could be used in many different ways. 

Pretty much whatever the mappers want to do with this, because you could construct:
- Timers
- Opening/Closing areas
- Triggering Cutscenes or something
- Changing levels
- Changing Textures
- Changing Music
- Changing Enemies
- Etc.
