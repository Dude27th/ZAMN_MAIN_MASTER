					|_____________________________|
					

The survivors even if they appear as a single entithy they are actually 5 actors working at 
the same point for each survivor on the map. Those actors are:

1. Survivor Spawn 	[Generic]
2. Survivor Actor
3. Alerter Point	[3.b. Spawns "InChase" Actor]
4. Pointer 			[Generic]
5. Survivor Storing



Survivor Spawn:
---------------

The survivor poits are the actor which are directly placed in the map, they have an argument
which takes their priority number [1 - 10*], at the start of every map they check if the
numbers of survivors left in the game is equal or more than his priority number.

If that's true it spawns his corresponding Survivor Actor and then it despawns itself.
If that's false then it doesnt spawn his Survivor Actor and it just despawns itself.

Also added recently as a second argument is the "Survivor Scripts" in which you can put 
a number of a script to launch in case of save/death of the survivor. For more info you can
read the "[GUIDE] SurvivorScripts" file.


*: 	The priority ranging from 1 - 10 is just based on the original ZAMN design, it is meant 
	at some point to be expanded to 20, for use with bigger or experimental maps.
	[Update:	The range now extends to 20! You need to use before hand "SurvivorLimit" in the
	Startup Scripts from the map, to set the new limit]



Survivor Actor:
---------------

This is the actor which plays the animations mostly of each survivor, in some cases it also checks
for enemies nearby to play special animations like the "Dog Survivor" or the "Soldier Survivor",  
and it also stores his health but it is invulnerable to all** types of direct damage.

It spawns two other actors, the "Alerter Point" and the "Pointer" refered in Decorate as
"Survivor Pointer"


**:	All the damage is supposed to be only dealt trough the "Alerter Point" actor, but at this
	current date (27/05/2021) they are suceptible to some forms of splash damage.
	Even tho this is considered a bug, the bug is still being studied.



Alerter Point:
--------------

This actor works as the AI of each survivor, it mainly search for players nearby and when it detects
any player it will spawn a temporal actor (to exist only when there is still players nearby),
this spawned actor is named "InChase" which the enemies chase for actively.

If an enemy attacks and sucesfully hits the "InChase" actor, the damage is passed to the "Alerter Point"
and then the "Alerter Point" will pass the damage to his "Survivor Actor", effectively killing him,
damaging him, or by doing nothing, based on the type of damage and type of survivor.



Pointer (Survivor Pointer):
---------------------------

This actor only exist to do one thing only, to be an invisible item at the survivor exact position.
This is because that, based on the behaviour of the survivors, they are considered to be a sort
of hybrid between a monster and an item.

And to the Radar Scripts it detects them as a monster, so this survivor pointer is placed at their
spots to appear in the radar as items, which detects the Radar showcasing them with the yellow 
circle, reminiscent to the original ZAMN.



Survivor Storing:
-----------------

So, initially this was done with several actors which worked as tokens, and with a script 
wich was triggered upon pickup/death of a survivor it was calculated 
how many survivors: / where in the map / where left / the limit of survivors to spawn/ game over / 

This was reworked at some point, thanks to a simplification of the level progression which allowed
the script to solve this with arrays instead of with tokens, regardless the tokens haven't been 
removed completely at this point.


[Deprecated::] New implementation below
/*	
Everytime a survivor is saved and stored in the array, it sets an id wich represents the type of the survivor saved,
and the index in that array sets the order in which the survivors where saved.

Those IDs are:
--------------

[ZAMN Survivors]
1: Soldier Survivor
2: Baby Survivor
3: Pool Dude Survivor
4: Teacher Survivor
5: Dog Survivor
6: Cheerleader Survivor
7: Tourists Survivor
8: Explorer Survivor
9: Chef Survivor
10: Jumping Kid Survivor
11: Son Of Dr Tongue Survivor


[Ghoul Patrol Survivors]
12:
13:
14:
15:
16:
17:
18:
19:
20:
*/

[Updated::] At the start of the level an array is constructed with the name of every survivor present on the map,
and they fill the array with their index being the same as their priority on the map.

["Surv_1"]["Surv_2"]["Surv_3"]["Surv_4"]["Surv_5"]["Surv_6"]["Surv_7"]["Surv_8"]["Surv_9"]["Surv_10"]



Everytime a survivor is saved, the game consults this array and copies it's information to a new array in which
the survivors are being stored with their name and the order in which they where saved.

["Surv_8"]["Surv_2"]["Surv_7"]["Surv_1"]["Surv_3"]["Surv_4"]["Surv_5"]["Surv_6"]["Surv_9"]["Surv_10"]



This changes from the previous implementation allows for endless survivor types, which would consede support
for easter egg survivors as well as custom new ones.



And that's it ^^!
Thanks for reading, this is not much as a guide but more of an insight about how do they work.
In case that I can't continue working on it I want to have pretty much every mechanic documented
as to not lost any of the work that has been done here.
