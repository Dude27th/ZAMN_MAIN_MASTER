//
//TODO LIST:
//----------- High Priority ------------//
//
// - [BUG] Failed Spawns:	Fixed with the Halloween Demo, altough the EvilDoll spawns still cause some issues.
//
// - Rework Triggers :		They don't need to have different actors for different palletes-.
//							It can just be an argument.
//
// - Weapons / Easter Eggs:	Use a global str to determine the game type, default should be ZAMN.
//							When all weapons cheat is active check this variable, and launch a Script Cleaning easter eggs weapon.
//							Easter Egg Weapons should inherit for differet weapon class actors. (Ex: "WeaponBase_Ghoul" | "WeaponBase_Smash" | "WeaponBase_Sky")
//							This way weapon detection is easier, hopefully.
//
//------------ Low Priority ------------//
//
// - [BUG]	:				Player pain sound doesn't activate always
//							
//
// - Frankestein:			Finish Voxel Spawn animation !
//							[RECOVERED !! I'LL FINISH THIS WHEN I CAN BUT, IM TIRED]
//							[MIGHT NEED ANOTHER MONTH FOR POLISHING, TOO MANY ASSETS WITHOUT A FINAL PASS :/]
//
// - RedBlob:				Try to fix their projectile, to move trough 3D floors. If they are outside the players sight.
//							(YEAH, HOW TO CHECK FOR IMPACT ON 3D FLOORS THO ?)
//
//-------------- Optional --------------//
//
// - Try to make a 3D model for the MartianRay weapon.	
//							(I NEED TO WORK WITH BLENDER AGAIN OR GOD HELP ME)
//
// - Chainsaw Maniacs:		Study more in depth and rework if necessary the Health and Damage Resistance of the Chainsaw Maniacs.
//							Apparently they have a large health pool but they can be killed faster under specific circustances.
//							The lives system might need some reworking.
//							(YEAH, SEVERAL MONSTERS NEED MORE FINE TUNNING, EVEN MORE NOW THAT)
//							(I HAVE MORE EXACT INFO ABOUT THEIR RESISTANCES, INCLUDING BOSSES)
//
//
//----------- Maybe won't fix ----------//
//
// - Zeke doesn't have Hurt Rotations but Julie does.		
//
// - Add the sprite variation of several voxel decorations. 	
//
// - Exit Door:  			If two survivor interactions occur at the same time the exit door might have 
//							his spawn coordinates overrated and spawn in the middle of both survivors.
