Hi ! ^^

Welcome to "Zombies Ate My Neighbors TC" !
This repository contains pretty much all the main data from the project
That being the Sprites, Music, Textures, Decorate Scripting, ACS Scripting, Other Miscellaneous files, Levels, etc etc

Pretty much everything needed to run the project under GZDoom or LZDoom ^^


How to compile this::
---------------------
You don't need to! ^^
If you just want to try a new dev version of the project, skip to "How to play this" down below!

Are you still here ?
If you are still reading this part I'll take it that you want to dig into the files of the project.

1) You'll need to download this repository as a .zip or clone it into a local directory

2) Then you'll need "Slade 3" to browse the files of the project and make changes, or import/export files from and to them.
You can use any new version of "Slade 3" 
From --> https://slade.mancubus.net/index.php?page=downloads
But the specific version I use is this one --> https://slade.mancubus.net/files/?dir=3.1.1.5

This will already give you access to all the files from the mod, the directories are pretty much self explainatory but if you are new to .pk3 format files
then you can take a look at this article for a brief explanation --> https://zdoom.org/wiki/Using_ZIPs_as_WAD_replacement#How_to

3) That's it, you can edit those files with your prefered tools, the files inside "acs_sources" are ACS Libraries, if you make any change to those they will need to be compiled again trough Slade3 and the ACC Compiler, the ACC Compiler can be found in the Editing section here --> https://zdoom.org/downloads#Editing

You have to extract to ACC Compiler into any folder and then set it up with Slade 3 as mentioned in this post --> https://www.doomworld.com/forum/post/1332759
And the compiled file with the ".o" extension should be moved to the "acs" directory and replace the previous one, as the LOADACS would be expecting to read them from there.

4) There you go! ^^
That should be all that you need to check and change as you wish
The GZDoom engine has some quirks, and I'm a little unorthodox while doing some stuff
But any question about any file you can ask them here and I'll answer as soon as I can ^^
Thanks for taking the time to read up until here!





How to play this::
---------------------
You can just download the entire repository as a .zip
And then you can launch it as is with GZDoom as a mod, or you can change it's extension to .ipk3 to launch it as a game
Have fun! ^^

- It's recommended that you check :
https://www.moddb.com/mods/zombies-doomed-my-neighbors-mod/downloads

And download the latest version of the project, those public versions usually come with addons and another goodies
So you can as well download the complete suit of the project and replace the main "ZAMN_MAIN" file 
with a fresh compiled one from this repository ^^



How can you help this project::
----------------------
Heh let's be real here, this in full completion would be a titanic project. I don't know if I can tackle it by myself alone at this rythm.
So here's some specifics on things that may help:

- Music: There's some missing tracks between the SNES/Megadrive versions of the game and I'm completely out of luck when it comes to music.
          If someone can for example make a SNES version of the missing Sega Genesis Tracks, or a Sega Genesis version of the Unused SNES Track
            I would be deeply grateful ;;

- Voxels: There's tons of missing voxels, pretty much tiny set pieces or decorations that feel that they would benefit for a more 3D body are completely welcome

- Coding: I'm not particulary good at it, if you find something that can be improved or some system that could be expanded upon , let me know ;;
            
- Weapon Sprites: There's still some missing weapons, help with any of those from base sprites to edit to existing or new sprites would be very helpful

Pretty much everything I've not mentioned I could be needing some help as well, 
so if there's something missing or that can be improved and you would like to colaborate with it I will welcome it with open arms and credit you for your help <3
