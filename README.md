Hi ! ^^

Welcome to "Zombies Ate My Neighbors TC" !
This repository contains pretty much all the main data from the project
That being the Sprites, Music, Textures, Decorate Scripting, ACS Scripting, Other Miscellaneous files, Levels, etc etc

Pretty much everything needed to run the project under GZDoom or LZDoom ^^


How to compile this::
---------------------
1) You don't!
2) You can just download the entire repository as a .zip
3) And then you can launch it as is with GZDoom as a mod, or you can change it's extension to .ipk3 to launch it as a game
4) Have fun! ^^


- It's recommended that you check :
https://www.moddb.com/mods/zombies-doomed-my-neighbors-mod/downloads

And download the latest version of the project, those public versions usually come with addons and another goodies
So you can as well download the complete suit of the project and replace the main "ZAMN_MAIN" file 
with a fresh compiled one from this repository ^^




How can you help this project::
----------------------
Heh let's be real here, this in full completion would be a titanic project. I don't know if I can tackle it by myself alone at this rythm.
So here's some specifics on things that may help:

- Music: There's some missing tracks between the SNES/Megadrive versions of the game and I'm completely out of luck when it comes to music.
          If someone can for example make a SNES version of the missing Sega Genesis Tracks, or a Sega Genesis version of the Unused SNES Track
            I would be deeply grateful ;;

- Voxels: There's tons of missing voxels, pretty much tiny set pieces or decorations that feel that they would benefit for a more 3D body are completely welcome

- Coding: I'm not particulary good at it, if you find something that can be improved or some system that could be expanded upon , let me know ;;
            
- Weapon Sprites: There's still some missing weapons, help with any of those from base sprites to edit to existing or new sprites would be very helpful

Pretty much everything I've not mentioned I could be needing some help as well, 
so if there's something missing or that can be improved and you would like to colaborate with it I will welcome it with open arms and credit you for your help <3
